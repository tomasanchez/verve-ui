Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound
by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0
International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public License
may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of
Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available
under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

a.  Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is
    derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material
    is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner
    requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor.
    For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work,
    performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the
    Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with an image.

b.  Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related
    to copyright, including, but not limited to, performance, broadcast, sound recording,
    and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
    categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section
    2(b)(1)-(2) are Not Copyright and Similar Rights.

c.  Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of
    proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under
    Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or
    similar international agreements.

d.  Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception
    or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed
    Material.

e.  Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to
    which the Licensor applied this Public License.

f.  Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You under the terms and conditions of
    this Public License, which are limited by the Exceptions and Limitations and
    Effective Technological Measures.

g.  Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public
    License.

h.  NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards commercial
    advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of this Public License, the
    exchange of the Licensed Material for other Licensed Material by digital file-sharing
    or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is no payment of monetary
    compensation in connection with the exchange.

i.  Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires
    permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public
    performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make
    material available to the public including through digital transmission so that
    members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually
    chosen by them.

j.  Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive
    96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
    protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
    equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

k.  You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public
    License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

    2.  If You create Adapted Material, You must also indicate that You have adapted the

    3.  You may fulfill the attribution requirement in any reasonable manner based on
        the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For

    absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors,
    whether or not discoverable. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied
    warranties, so this exclusion may not apply to You.

    theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special,
    indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs,
    expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed
    Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses,
    costs, expenses, or damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
    limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and
    limitation may not apply to You.

    Exceptions and Limitations to Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of
    the Licensed Material.

b.  Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, if any provision of this Public
    License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
    to make it enforceable.

c.  No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply
    consented to unless expressly agreed to in writing by the Licensor.
